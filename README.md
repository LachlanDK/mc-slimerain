## Features
- There is a 5% chance at the beginning of every Minecraft day that a slime rain will start.
	- Slime rains last for a whole Minecraft day.
- During a slime rain, slimes of various sizes spawn in the air above a player in a 20 block radius around them.
	- Slimes will not spawn inside a house or in any dimension other than the overworld.
	- Any skeletons that spawn during a slime rain will transform into a slime jockey!
- If players kill at least 100 slimes, the King Slime will spawn!
	- If this boss is killed, the slime rain will end.
- There are new advancements and rare mob loot to be collected from the slime rain!

## Planned Future Features
- More varieties of slimes (coloured slimes) to feel more like the Terraria event
- Improved boss mechanics
- Mob cap
- Minimum difficulty threshold similar to Terraria so that the slime rain will not start when players are completely underprepared
- More mob loot (slime related items inspired by loot from Terraria)
- Method of preventing slime rains using some kind of ritual
- Nether event similar to slime rain but utilising magma cubes
